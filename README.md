## Customer Product Review analysis using Watson Discovery

Let’s imagine, you have a ton of documents (JSON, HTML, PDF, Word, and so on) and your task is  to find the insights that are hiding in those documents. What are you going to do in this situation? You’re going to read and analyze each of the documents, but it is a time consuming process

Fortunately, IBM Watson Discovery was created to help us go through situations like this. IBM Watson Discovery is a cognitive search and content analytics engine that you can use to identify patterns, trends and actionable insights from structured and unstructured data (JSON, HTML, PDF, Word, and more) with speed and accuracy to drive better decision-making.

I can say that Discovery can handle every hardest thing for you. You just create an instance of Discovery, inject and persist data into collections (collection as a box where you store data in Discovery). Discovery will automatically ingest (convert, enrich, clean, and normalize), store, and query data to extract actionable insights. After that, you can easily search and query what you want from the original data.
